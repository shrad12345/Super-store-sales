📘 Project Summary – Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
This project focuses on building a comprehensive Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and present sales data in an interactive and meaningful way. The goal is to derive actionable business insights from the data to support strategic decision-making.

Monthly Sales Trends to track performance over time

A text-based insights section with observations and strategic recommendations

🔍 Business Insights
The dashboard highlights several useful patterns and trends, such as:

Regions or categories contributing the most to revenue

Time periods with peak sales performance

Underperforming areas that may need attention

Shifts in customer preferences over time

These insights can guide marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and pricing decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
